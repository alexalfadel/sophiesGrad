                Dearest Sophie.  It has been my pleasure to watch you grow into the person you are today. Like a flower, your gentle soul has blossomed with the fragrance, beauty, conviction and strength of young adulthood. Congratulations on achieving this first of many milestones. Always with love, Lora.

                This is your crazy uncle John. I’m so excited you’ve grown up to be such a beautiful girl and graduated from high school. You’re moving on to university where your crazy uncle graduated from. I wish you the beautiful time and experience with your classes and with your new friends. And have a successful life beyond what you’re expecting.
